# Major requirements
* Web UI, with parent login for generating videos (and payment options for the api costs), plus student logins (created by the parents) for granting access to the generated content. Allow parents to share generated content (therefore creating a potentially vast library of generated videos).

# Minor nice improvements
* Request a heading name for each section, and display it in between clips (less choppy this way).
* Generate a final summary for properly wrapping up the video.
